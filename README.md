## 1. Overall project description

-This project proposes the **Design-on-Graph** method, which is an intelligent design framework for manufacturing systems based on **GraphRAG​**. It utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to efficiently manage domain knowledge and automatically generate design solutions.


-The ontology and knowledge graph constructed for this project can be found in the GitHub repository, with the following links: https://github.com/zhengxiaochen/ontology_aircraft_system

### 1.1 Core Innovation：
- 🧠 ​**Knowledge dynamic retrieval**​：Using a multi round dialogue mechanism to intelligently retrieve structured constraint conditions from the knowledge graph in the manufacturing field

- 🏭 ​**Context aware design**​：Utilizing dialogue history archiving to achieve continuous accumulation of design knowledge and contextual inference
  
- ✈️ ​**Industrial grade verification**​：Constructing a complete AI agent workflow using the aircraft fuselage connection system as a testing scenario
  

### 1.2 Technical highlights：
✅ ​**Cross modal knowledge fusion**​  
Unify the encoding of structured knowledge (graph data) such as topological constraints and physical parameters of manufacturing systems with natural language descriptions (text data)

✅ ​**Multi objective optimization support**​  
Balancing multidimensional optimization objectives such as production efficiency, cost control, and performance indicators through LLM's chain reasoning capability

✅ ​**Interpretable design**​  
All generated design schemes come with a knowledge traceability path, supporting the retrieval of original domain knowledge nodes through backtracking 

### 1.3 Core Content：
The design of large-scale equipment manufacturing systems plays a crucial role in ensuring product performance, optimizing production efficiency, and reducing lifecycle costs. Effective reuse of domain knowledge is essential for maintaining both the quality and efficiency of manufacturing system design. Although existing knowledge graph technologies standardize the representation and storage of such domain knowledge, the complex design constraints and multiple optimization objectives of manufacturing systems still pose significant challenges to the efficient reuse of domain knowledge. Recent advancements in the large language model (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have led to the emergence of graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG), which presents a promising approach to overcoming these challenges. This paper proposes a novel GraphRAG-based method, Design-on-Graph, to support knowledge management and automated generation of design plans for manufacturing systems. This method employs the LLM to intelligently retrieve and verbalize structured domain knowledge through multi-turn conversations, achieving high-efficiency knowledge management for manufacturing systems. Additionally, the retrieved domain knowledge is systematically archived within conversation history, providing contextual support for LLM-driven reasoning tasks to streamline automated design processes. Finally, a case study on an aircraft fuselage joint system serves as the test scenario, and an AI agent incorporating all the above functionalities is developed to demonstrate and evaluate the performance of the proposed Design-on-Graph method.

​**Role**: Aircraft Assembly Planning Expert  
​**Task**: You are an expert in aircraft fuselage assembly planning. Your task is to generate a complete and feasible assembly scheme based only on the conversation history and current question.

Conversation history: {history}

Current question: {question}

​**Process Requirements**:
Phase 1. ​**Data Extraction**​  
- Extract ALL operations and resources from conversation history, show them as a table
1. For each operation, document:  
▪ Type (Manual/Automatic)  
▪ Duration (min)  
▪ Required Resources (name (number))  
▪ Immediate Predecessors  
2. For each resource, document:
▪ Cost (€/h)  
▪ Calendar  
▪ Quantity 

Phase 2. ​**Constraint Analysis**​  
- Analysis specific constraints
- Analysis automatic and manual quarter aircraft fuselage assembly logic
- List the sequence chains of operations required to complete one automatic 1/4 body assembly
- List the sequence chains of operations required to complete one manual 1/4 body assembly

Phase 3. ​**Scheme Generation**​  
- Generate a complete aircraft fuselage assembly scheme following the output format, including the assembly of four quarter-fuselages.
- The generated scheme must meet the following requirements：
▪ Only the same manual operations can be carried out in parallel
▪ Automatic operations cannot be carried out in parallel with any other operations
- Output Format:
| Order | Operation | Type | Required Resources | Duration | Start Time | End Time | Parallel Group |
|-------|-----------|------|---------- ---------|----------|------------|----------|----------------|
Note:
▪ Order: Use a single number (1, 2, 3, ...) if it is executed sequentially
▪ Order: Use number + letter suffix (4a, 4b) if it is executed in parallel
▪ Parallel Group: Use letter suffix (a, b)
▪ This plan must include the assembly of four quarter-fuselages.
▪ You must generate a complete list of scheme without any form of omission

Phase 4. ​**Validation Report**:
- Check if the following conditions are met. Mark ✓ if met, and ✗ if not met.
▪ [✓/✗] Completed 4 assemblies of 1/4 body
▪ [✓/✗] Automatic operations are executed sequentially
▪ [✓/✗] No manual/auto overlap
▪ [✓/✗] Shared steps correctly positioned 
▪ [✓/✗] Resource limits maintained
- If any of the conditions is not met, re-execute phase 3.
